# InteractiveRating
This is front end development project to create and interactive rating page.
Project Brief:

Your challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go. 

Your users should be able to: 

Select and submit a number rating 

See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating 

View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size 

See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
